# Credit Default Risk Model
Financial industrials use credit score to evaluate the likelihood for existing and prospective customers to default and decide whether to grant credit or not. The precise judgment of the creditworthiness allows us to increase the volume of granted credit while minimizing possible losses.
Data include payment, balance and some external credit report information. The dependent variable is the customer defaulted or no after 6 months. 
This model uses XGB package to predict the probability that an account will have delinquency, charge-off or bankrupt at the end of next six months. 
Performance is good, evaluated by AUC and gain chart.
